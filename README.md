# SlideShowMaker
Thia ia a simple tool to solve a simple problem. Turn a folder full of images into a slideshow! I had a need for such a tool for a recent project of mine so decided to make it and share


Usage: 

1. pip install -r requirements.txt
2. sudo apt update
3. sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
4. python3 slideshow.py
   



Very customizable, please enjoy!
